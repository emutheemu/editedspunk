		<p>Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main contributors to making interesting and dynamic web pages. It enables web pages to be interactive and thus is an essential part of web applications. Most websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it. Lets look at how using Javascript can add interactivity to HTML pages. </p>

		<p> Javascript can be directly embedded into your HTML page, so no external file is needed. It is object-based code, uses built in extensible objects but no classes or inheritance.</p>

		<p> Javascript can be used to react to user or page events. For example, on a shopping website after a 30 second timer, a pop up may appear in order to try and sell you something, such as a subscription to the site. This pop up is written in Javascript, the timer included.</p>

		<p> Other examples of how Javascript is used may be to read and write HTML elements, to validate data, to detect the users browser and to create cookies. Declare javascript code in an XHTML document using the < script >< /script > tags </p>

		<h2> Where To Put Javascript </h2>
		<p> Simple Script- <br /> -Executed when the page loads, place in < script > < / script> tags within the body. <br />
			-If you have a script that is to be loaded when it is called or an event is triggered, put it in the < head> section.</p>
		<h3> Events </h3>
		<p> -Events are actions the user performs while visiting your page. For example, submitting a form, moving a mouse over an image, are all events. Javascript deals with events using event handlers. An action is triggered by the event handler. Built in event handlers include the following:<br/>

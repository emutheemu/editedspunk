	<p><h2>GETTING STARTED</h2></p>
<p> The goal of this website is to guide you through the web development process from start to finish. We hereby dedicate ourselves to help you make sense of key technologies, standards, tools and processes used in the creation of your website so you can be involved in the design process with us.<br/></p>
<p><h2>THERE ARE THREE CORE PHASES:</h2><p>
 Design.
 Development.
 Deployment.<br/>
<p>Let’s look at how designing works first.The design phase consists of three main activities including <b>requirements gathering, wireframing and prototyping.</b> Requirements gathering involves getting into the head of the users. It is the MVP of the design process. User-centered design is based on the explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are involved throughout the design and development phases by means of user testing, persona creation and prototyping. </p>
<p>At Spunk, our design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation. People are listened to, all elements of the website are called into question and a holistic product is therefore developed in order to drive your sales and stimulate website clicks.
Here at Spunk, the entire user experience matters, not just the design of the user Interface.</p>

	<p><h3> The interface is created using three languages:</h3><br />
	 HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. <br />
	HTML is the language for building web pages.
		CSS is the language for styling them<br />
		and Javascript is the language for programming them, or adding behaviour to them.</p>
		<p id="htmlstart"> Let's look at how to use HTML first. </p>

		<p>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.  has various tags to format the contents of your webpage. Content varies from text to images and videos etc. The <u> five essential tags </u> needed to start a webpage are: <br /></p>
<img id="fiveessentials" src="fiveessentials.jpg" alt="html tags" title="fiveessentialtags" height="200px" width="300px">
<p> --The < html > tag defines the document as a webpage and identifies the beginning and end of the html document. All other tags fall in between. <br />
	--The < head > tags, or header contain information about the document that wont be present on the actual web page, but will define the title of the document, the author, which stylesheet to use and also meta tags. <br />
	--The < title > tag defines the title that appears on the title bar of your web browser. The title appears between the head tags. <br />
	--The < body > tag contains within it all the information and visable content on the page, all your images links and plain text must go between these tags.<br /> 
--There must only be one set of each and they must follow this order.</p>

			<p> With these five essential tags you will be able to start building your website, but in order to get the building blocks talking to how they shall be styled,  a link to the CSS styleseet is needed. It is as follows: <br />
				 <p id="stylesheet"> <u> <b>< link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" ></u></b></p>
				 <p> The stylesheet link is placed under the < title > tag. But we will get to CSS in a minute.<br />

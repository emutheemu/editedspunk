		<div class="boxOne"><p> <u>An understanding of HTML is crucial to starting CSS, as CSS adds style to your HTML.</u><br/></p> <p>Adding CSS can completely control how your web pages look without changing your HTML. For example, you can build a wall with HTML, but you will need CSS to paint it and round off the edges.</p>
 
<p>CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is green, all paragraphs should appear in black using the Impact typeface, or that all level one headings should be in blue, bold, Times typeface.</p>
 
<p>The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an <u>invisible box</u> around every HTML element. CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box and the contents within it, is presented.<br /></p>
 
 
<p>For example:</p><h1><img id="invisibebox" src="invisiblebox.jpg" alt="information on how css worls" title="invisible box" width="400px" height="300px" align="center"></h1>
 <p><u>BOXES</u><br />
-Width and height<br />
-Borders (color, width, and style)<br />
-Background color and images <br />
-Position in the browser window.<br />
<u>TEXT</u><br/>
-Typeface<br/>
-Size<br/>
-Colour<br/>
-Italics, bold, uppercase,<br/>
-Lowercase, small-caps.<br/>
<u>HOW DOES IT WORK?</u><br/>
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a SELECTOR and a DECLARATION as seen in the following image:<br/>
<h1><img id="cssselector" src="cssselector.jpg" alt="information on how to target HTML with CSS" title="CSS selector" height="200px" width="400px" float="center"></h1></p></div>

<div class="boxTwo">

	<p>-SELECTORS indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.<br/>
		-DECLARATIONS indicate how the elements referred to in the selectorr should be styled.<br/>
	-Declarations are also split into two parts, a property and a calue and are seperated by a colon.<br />
-CSS rules usually appear externally in a seperate document saved in the same file as your index.html doc, although they also may appear within the HTML page using inline CSS by placing them inside a < style > element, which usually sits inside the < head > element of the page.</p>

	<p>The colour property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:<br/></p>

<p>-RGB VALUES<br/>
-COLOUR NAMES<br/>
-HEX CODES<br/></p>

	<h2><u> The Importance of Contrast.</u></h2>

	<p> It is importnat to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background colour in order for people to be able to read your website's content. CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opactiy. It is known as RGBA </p>

	<p> You can also add different opacity to your content, such as images. The following image shows you how to write the code to do so, and will be helpful if you are to make use of photographs for your website. Click on the image to be taken to W3Schools to learn more</p>
